This is NemoPreview, a quick previewer for Nautilus, the GNOME desktop file manager.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NemoPreview is a DBus-activated service. For NemoPreview to popup, applications will have
to call the ShowFile method on the org.nemo.Preview interface.
If you want to or debug NemoPreview without a calling application, you can use
gdbus(1) to call the ShowFile method manually on the bus.

If a XID is specified, the NemoPreview window is made transient to that window.
If the CloseIfShown parameter is TRUE, NemoPreview will close if it's already
running.
