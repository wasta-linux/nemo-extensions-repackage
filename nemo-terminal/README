==============================================================================

Nemo Terminal is an embedded terminal for Nemo, the Cinnamon file manager.

Nemo Terminal follows your navigation in a shell accessible by hotkey (F4, by
default) in a resizeable pane in Nemo. It eliminates the grunt work of
navigating multiple folder levels just to run a single shell command and cuts
down on window clutter from multiple terminals and file managers.

Features include:
    * Automatically follows folder navigation.
        * Even onto GVFS mounted volumes.
    * Copy/Paste and Paste Filename support.
    * Drag/Drop acquisition of filenames from Nemo.

Features in development:
    * Two-way folder navigation - Nemo will follow the current directory in the
      terminal.

This package is a fork of the Nautilus Terminal project to support the Nemo
file browser and includes various improvements and bugfixes.

Credit for the original work goes to the Nautilus Terminal authors
(see AUTHORS for more detail).
