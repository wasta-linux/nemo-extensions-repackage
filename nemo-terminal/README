==============================================================================

Nemo Terminal is a terminal embedded in Nemo, the Cinnamon file
browser. It is always open in the current folder, and follows the navigation
(the "cd" command is automatically executed when you move to an other folder).
Nemo Terminal have a lot of functionalities:

    * It always follows your navigation in your folders.
    * It supports Copy/Paste (Ctrl+Shift+C / *Ctrl+Shift+V).
    * It supports drag & drop of files and folders.
    * It can be hidden/shown when you want (with the F4 key).
    * It is resizeable.

This package is the port of the Nautilus Terminal project to support the Nemo
file browser fork. All credit for the original work goes to the Nautilus 
Terminal authors (listed in AUTHORS).
